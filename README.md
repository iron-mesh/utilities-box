**PUSSY** is a program complex that accelerates the development of GUI applications (plugins) on **Python** and **PySide6**. The complex includes a framework for developing plugins and a Manager program for managing them. It allows you to collect all applications in one place, and allows you  to disable plugins that are not used. Also, the main advantage is that a developer only needs to declare one class with custom settings, **one parameter = one line of code**. The system creates the interface for their I/O and performs hard disk storage.


## Manager launching

**WARNING!** The program was developed and tested on **Python 3.11** and **Windows 10**. It is not guaranteed to work on other platforms. If you want to take part in adapting and testing the code for other platforms, please write to [✉ e-mail](mailto:products@ironmesh.ru).

To run the script, the **PySide6** framework must be installed, it сan be installed by command:
```
pip install PySide6
```
Then you need to run the file **PUSSY.pyw**
